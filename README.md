an tiny idea about a better patent solution

## Disclaimer 
I am not a lawyer, have not been in the pharmacy industry, I am just an small engineer that has seen how open source has changed the software industry so much and impacted the whole world so great. So this is just a tiny idea hoping to trigger some thinking and discussion about a better patent solution.  

## The Problem
In the medicines world, companies like Novartis spent huge amount of money inventing new medicines to cure patients, meanwhile there are also tons of money on failures. They should definitely be rewarded in some way, otherwise no one would ever want to invest in the high risk high failure area. 

On the other side, patients, their family, the insurance companies are paying tons of money buying high price medicines as well, many people got bankrupted, died because they can not afford the latest medicines. 

So, I am wondering if there could be a better innovative way to solve this problem better. 

## Open Source in the software industry
In the software industry, the open source movement has changed the industry so much. The big giants and small startups  are running millions of Linux servers without paying any server license fee, tens of millions of engineers are writing java codes without paying a cent to Sun or Oracle. The whole big data world has been benefited a lot from Google's GFS/BigTable/MapReduce paper and thus Hadoop ecosystem, also tons of great things are built on top of MySQL/Spark/Kafka and so on. 

In short, the whole information technology wouldn't be so great as it is without open source, and it's not only changing silicon valley, but changed almost everyone in the world because of all the software and products we are using everyday. 

## Open Patent Idea
while the open source mechanism may not be perfect today, such as the authors are not rewarded enough compared to their contribution. 
I think, maybe the pharmacy industry could still borrow similar idea and make a better world that can benefit everyone in the world. 

The idea is simple: 
Different companies could open patent in some group that can be shared within the group, so that they can be rewarded by everyone's success and cover its own failures. Small companies could join the group so that initially they can benefit from the group and then rewarding back to the group when they grow big. 

Maybe, in this way, we can accelerate the world industry's innovation speed and create a better world, making people heathy with a more affordable new medicines.
